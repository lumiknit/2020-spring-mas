\section*{Problem 1}

Prove that \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-n^2}z^n\) is an entire function.

\subsection*{Proof}

Let \(f(z) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-n^2}z^n\).

Let \(L = \limsup_{n \to \infty} |e^{-n^2}|^{1/n}\).
Since \(e^x\) is strictly increasing positive function
and \(-n\) is strictly decreasing as \(n\) increases,
\(|e^{-n^2}|^{1/n} = e^{-n^2 / n} = e^{-n}\)
and \(0 < e^{- (n+1)} < e^{-n}\) for every \(n \in \bbN\).
It implies \(L = \limsup_{n \to \infty} |e^{-n^2}|^{1/n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} e^{-n} = 0\).
By Theorem 2.8, the given power series \(f(z)\) converges everywhere in \(\bbC\).

By Corollary 2.10, \(f(z)\) is infinitely differentiable its convergence domain.
And since \(f(z)\) converges in \(\bbC\), \(f(z)\) is infinitely differentiable in every point of \(\bbC\).
Thus \(f(z)\) is entire.
